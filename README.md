# DevOps

DevOps: Development & Operation - is a set of automated software practices that combine software development (Dev), testing and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the software development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in alignment with the business’ objectives.

**DevOps movement:**
1. Continuous Integration (CI). Continuous Integration is about automating build and test processes to make sure the resulting software is in a good state, ideally every time a developer changes code. CI helps development teams avoid integration issues where the software works on individual developers’ machines, but it fails when all developers combine their code.

2. Continuous Delivery (CD). Continuous Delivery goes one step further to automate a software release, which typically involves packaging the software for deployment in a production-like environment. The goal of CD is to make sure the software is always ready to go to production, even if the team decides not to do it for business reasons.

3. Continuous Deployment (also CD). Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There’s no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.

4. Continuous Testing. One of the hottest buzz terms in the testing world, continuous testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with a release candidate. Continuous testing cannot be implemented without test automation.
